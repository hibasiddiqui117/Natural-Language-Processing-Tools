# Natural-Language-Processing-Tools And Techniques 
I have led and executed complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, showcasing my expertise across a wide range of NLP techniques. I have developed and implemented various NLP projects that demonstrate my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. My projects involve leveraging advanced NLP techniques for real-world applications, including:
Semantic Search: Implemented robust search systems that understand user intent and deliver relevant results beyond keyword matching.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Built models to identify and classify key entities such as names, organisations, and locations in unstructured text data.
Keyword Extraction & Keyword Cloud: Extracted meaningful keywords to summarise documents and visualise word significance.
Machine Translation: Developed multilingual translation models that ensure accurate and coherent cross-language text conversion.
Question Answering (QnA): Engineered systems to process and respond to user queries in natural language.
Topic Modelling: Applied topic modelling to discover underlying themes in large datasets.
Text Summarization: Created models to generate concise summaries of long-form text, ensuring readability and information retention.
Sentiment Analysis: Analysed text to gauge public sentiment, providing insights for decision-making in various domains.
These projects were centred around deriving meaningful insights from large-scale, unstructured text data and deploying solutions that drive real-world impact.
